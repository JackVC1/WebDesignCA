Webpage made using html and customized using CSS and SASS/SCSS.

Bootstrap used for many different parts of the website such as grids, spacing, components, images etc

This webpage is used to describe the app we have designed in UX/UI module: Smart Guide

There are 3 pages - a general home page with some basic info on the app, a testimonial and a neurodivergence section
2 - an informational about us page containing large info sections with text and images and an accordian used as a FAQ section
3 - Our Services page which describes the services provided by the app such as organising briefs - to-do lists - research and bookmarking

SASS is used to create custom colours which I have used throughout the webpage.
